Usage: ./runner.sh --flag1 --flag2 --flag3
Flags are optional.

Options:
 --debug - Debug mode, show each instruction executed by the script.
 --sys-trace - For each failed execution, create a log for each of
 the following values, measured during command execution:
      processes/threads and CPU usage of the command
      network card package counters
 --net-trace - For each failed execution, create a ‘pcap’ file with
 the network traffic during the execution.

*You may use the flags in what order you like.

*When executing the script it will wait for your command.
 After entering the command press enter ant wait for the script to finish.
*If interrupted, the script will print the most recent exit code.
